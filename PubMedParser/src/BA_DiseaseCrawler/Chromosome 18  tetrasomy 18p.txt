The symptoms of tetrasomy p vary from case to case but may include craniofacial abnormalities; malformations of the spine, hands, or feet; neuromuscular abnormalities; kidney malformations; moderate to severe mental retardation; limitations in speech; and/or behavioral abnormalities. In most cases, tetrasomy p is the result of a spontaneous (de novo) genetic change (mutation) early in embryonic development that occurs for unknown reasons (sporadic).', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Tetrasomy', u' Short Arm of Chromosome 18', u'Tetrasomy 18p', u'Isochromosome 18p'], 'uid': ''}
