{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) is a genetic disorder that is typically characterized by tall height; skinny, long limbs; long, skinny fingers and toes (arachnodactyly); multiple joint deformities present at birth (congenital contractures), usually of the elbows, knees, hips, fingers and ankles; "crumpled"-looking ears, and curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis). Other features might also be present and vary from person to person. CCA is caused by mutations in a gene called FBN gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. CCA shares similiar signs and symptoms to Marfan syndrome; however, Marfan syndrome is not caused by mutations in the FBN gene.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Beals syndrome', u'Arachnodactyly', u' contractural Beals type', u'Contractures', u' multiple with arachnodactyly', u'Ear anomalies-contractures-dysplasia of bone with kyphoscoliosis', u'Beals-Hecht syndrome', u'CCA'], 'uid': u'121050'}
