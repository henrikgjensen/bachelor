It is a benign disease which is characterized by over-production and accumulation of a specific type of white blood cell (histiocyte) in the lymph nodes of the body, most often those of the neck (cervical). Other lymph node groups may also be involved and, in some cases, abnormal accumulation of histiocytes may occur in other areas of the body (extranodal). The cause of this condition remains unknown, although altered immune responses and infectious agents may play a role. SHML is a self-limited and seldom life-threatening disease which commonly does not require therapy.
