Job syndrome is characterized by abnormally high levels of an immune system protein called immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the blood, which is why this condition is also known as hyper IgE syndrome. IgE triggers an immune response against foreign invaders in the body, particularly parasitic worms, and plays a role in allergies. It is unclear why people with Job syndrome have such high levels of IgE. Some cases of Job syndrome are caused by mutations in the STAT gene. In other cases, the cause is unknown.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [], 'uid': ''}
