In pachygyria, the gyri are relatively few and are unusually broad and flat. The condition does not affect the entire brain, and is also known as \xe2\x80\x98incomplete lissencephaly.\xe2\x80\x99 Symptoms are variable, but may include seizures, developmental delay, growth failure, small head size, feeding issues and poor muscle control.
