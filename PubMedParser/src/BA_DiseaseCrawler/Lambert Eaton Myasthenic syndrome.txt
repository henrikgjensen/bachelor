The neuromuscular junction is the site where nerve cells meet muscle cells and help activate the muscles. This syndrome occurs when antibodies interfere with electrical impulses between the nerve and muscle cells. It may be associated with other autoimmune diseases, or more commonly coincide with or precede a diagnosis of cancer such as small cell lung cancer. Symptoms may include muscle weakness, a tingling sensation in the affected areas, fatigue, and dry mouth. Treatment of a underlying disorder or cancer is the first priority of treatment.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'LEMS', u'Eaton Lambert syndrome', u'Lambert Eaton syndrome', u'Myasthenic syndrome of Lambert-Eaton', u'Myasthenic-Myopathic syndrome of Lambert-Eaton'], 'uid': ''}
