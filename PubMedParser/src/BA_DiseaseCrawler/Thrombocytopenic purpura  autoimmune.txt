This is because platelets are being destroyed by the immune system. Symptoms may include bruising, nosebleed or bleeding in the mouth, bleeding into the skin, and abnormally heavy menstruation. With treatment, the chance of remission (a symptom-free period) is good. Rarely thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune may become a chronic ailment in adults and reappear, even after remission.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura', u'ITP', u'Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura'], 'uid': ''}
