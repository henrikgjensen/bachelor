The seizures of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy often occur when people first awaken in the morning, especially if they are sleep-deprived. Drinking alcohol and psychological stress may also make these seizures more likely. Onset typically occurs around adolesence in otherwise healthy children. The exact cause of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy remains unknown. Although patients usually require lifelong treatment with anticonvulsants, their overall prognosis is generally good.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Petit mal', u' impulsive', u'JME', u'EJM', u'Janz syndrome', u'Myoclonic epilepsy', u' juvenile', u' 1'], 'uid': ''}
