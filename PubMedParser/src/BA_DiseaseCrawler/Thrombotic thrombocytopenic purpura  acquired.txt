These clots can cause serious medical problems if they block vessels and restrict blood flow to organs such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. Resulting complications can include neurological problems (such as personality changes, headaches, confusion, and slurred speech), fever, abnormal kidney function, abdominal pain, and heart problems.\n', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Purpura', u' thrombotic thrombocytopenic', u'TTP', u'Moschowitz syndrome', u'Idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura'], 'uid': ''}
