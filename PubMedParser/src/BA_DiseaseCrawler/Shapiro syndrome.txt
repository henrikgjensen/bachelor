The duration and frequency of the episodes vary from person to person, with some episodes lasting hours to weeks and occurring from hours to years; the reason for the variations in the episodes is not yet known. The cause of the condition is currently unknown; however, a "resetting" of the temperature of the body to a lower level has been suggested. Although different treatment options have been attempted in some patients, the treatments have been unsuccessful or of doubtful efficacy because of the small number of individuals that have been documented as having this condition.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Shapiro&#39;s syndrome', u'Recurrent spontaneous hypothermia with hypoplasia of the corpus callosum', u'Spontaneous periodic hypothermia syndrome', u'Spontaneous recurrent hypothermia syndrome'], 'uid': ''}
