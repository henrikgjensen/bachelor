{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is a genetic condition that affects many parts of the body. The major features of this disorder include a characteristic facial appearance, delayed growth and development, intellectual disability, and seizures. Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material near the end of the short (p) arm of chromosome . This chromosomal change is sometimes written as p-. The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals; studies suggest that larger deletions tend to result in more severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities than smaller deletions. Most cases of this disorder are not inherited, although sometimes Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is inherited from an unaffected parent.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'WHS', u'Wolf syndrome', u'Chromosome 4p syndrome', u'Microcephaly', u' IUGR', u' Hypertelorism', u' Ptosis', u' iris coloboma', u' hooked nose', u' external ear dysplasia', u' psychomotor retardation'], 'uid': u'194190'}
