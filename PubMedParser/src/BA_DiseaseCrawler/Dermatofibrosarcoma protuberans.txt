The tumor may cause no symptoms, is firm, and often flesh-colored (although it can be pigmented, reddish, bluish, or purplish). The tumor is often found on the trunk, particularly the chest or shoulders, but can be found on other parts of the body as well. The initial size of the tumor tends to be around  to  cm, but can be larger. This tumor tends to grow locally and has an intermediate potential to spread to other tissues (metastasize). Treatment often involves the surgical removal of the tumor, such as by Mohs\xe2\x80\x99 micrographic surgery or by wide local excision.
