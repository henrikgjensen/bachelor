{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Wernicke\'s encephalopathy is a degenerative brain disorder caused by the lack of thiamine (vitamin B). It may result from alcohol abuse, dietary deficiencies, prolonged vomiting, eating disorders, or the effects of chemotherapy. Korsakoff\'s amnesic syndrome-a memory disorder-also results from a deficiency of thiamine, and is associated with alcoholism. The heart, vascular, and nervous system are involved. Although Wernicke\'s and Korsakoff\'s may appear to be two different disorders, they are generally considered to be different stages of the same disorder, which is called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Wernicke\'s encephalopathy represents the "acute" phase of the disorder, and Korsakoff\'s amnesic syndrome represents the "chronic" phase.
