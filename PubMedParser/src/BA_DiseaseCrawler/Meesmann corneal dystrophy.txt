{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Meesmann corneal dystrophy is a rare genetic condition affecting the epithelial membrane of the cornea. A slit-lamp examination of the cornea shows diffuse clusters of tiny round cysts in the epithelial membrane.  Overtime these cysts can rupture and cause erosions. The erosions may result in light sensitivity, redness, and pain. Vision remains good in most cases. Meesmann corneal dystrophy can be caused by mutations in the KRT or KRT gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Click here to view an image of the eye which includes an illustration of the epithelial membrane of the cornea.
