{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Beta-thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin. Without sufficient hemoglobin, red blood cells do not develop normally, causing a shortage of mature red blood cells. The low number of mature red blood cells leads to anemia and other health problems. Severe beta thalassemia is called \xe2\x80\x9cthalassemia major\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cCooley\xe2\x80\x99s anemia.\xe2\x80\x9d Thalassemia intermedia is the less severe form. Mutations in the HBB gene cause beta thalassemia. Beta thalassemia is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, which means people with beta thalassemia have mutations in both of their HBB genes. People who have only one HBB mutation may have no symptoms or develop mild symptoms. People with one HBB mutation and mild symptoms are said to have thalassemia minor.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Cooley&#39;s anemia', u'Mediterranean anemia', u'Erythroblastic anemia', u'Thalassemia major &#40;Beta-thalassemia major&#41;', u'Thalassemia intermedia', u'Thalassemia minor &#40;Beta-thalassemia minor&#41;'], 'uid': u'604131'}
