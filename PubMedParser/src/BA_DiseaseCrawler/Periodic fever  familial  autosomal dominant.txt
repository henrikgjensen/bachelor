The former name of this syndrome was familial Hibernian fever and it is sometimes referred to as tumor necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome or TRAPS. Familial autosomal dominant periodic fever is caused by mutations in the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor gene (TNFRSFA), which are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Although there is no proven definitive treatment to prevent or cure this condition, various anti-inflammatory agents may help to relieve symptoms. Nonetheless, most patients will experience episodes of symptoms throughout their life.
