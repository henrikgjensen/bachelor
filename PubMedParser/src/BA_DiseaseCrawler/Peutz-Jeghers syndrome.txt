{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition characterized by multiple benign polyps called hamartomas on the mucous lining in the gastrointestinal system. These polyps occur most often in the small intestine but also occur in the stomach and large intestine. Affected individuals also have dark skin discoloration, especially around the eyes, nostrils, mucous membranes of the mouth, perianal area and inside the mouth. Affected individuals have an increased risk for intestinal and other cancers. Most cases of PJS can be attributed to mutations in the STK gene.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Polyposis', u' hamartomatous intestinal', u'PJS', u'Polyps-and-spots syndrome', u'Peutz-Jeghers polyposis', u'Periorificial lentiginosis syndrome', u'Lentiginosis', u' perioral', u'Peutz Jeghers syndrome'], 'uid': u'175200'}
