In this condition, the tarsal navicular bone is broken down and than hardens (i.e., calcifies) resulting in swelling and foot pain. This condition most often affects children aged  to  years and usually involves just one foot. Treatment may involve rest and avoiding excessive weight bearing. Prognosis (long term outlook) for children with this condition is usually excellent.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Kohler&#39;s Disease', u'Kohler&#39;s Disease of the Tarsal Navicular', u'Kohler&#39;s Osteochondrosis of the Tarsal Navicular', u'Navicular Osteochondrosis'], 'uid': ''}
