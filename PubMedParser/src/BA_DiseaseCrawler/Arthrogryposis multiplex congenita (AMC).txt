The term is currently used in connection with a very heterogeneous group of disorders that all include the common feature of multiple congenital joint contractures. The exact cause of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita is unknown, though a number of different theories have been proposed, including mechanical obstruction in utero, viral infections, or faulty development of the central nervous or muscular systems.. Some cases are believed to be inherited.
