It can affect fetuses or newborns, and premature babies are at the greatest risk of the disorder. PVL is caused by a lack of oxygen or blood flow to the area around the ventricles of the brain, which results in the death of brain tissue. Although babies with PVL generally have no apparent signs or symptoms of the disorder, they are at risk for motor disorders, delayed mental development, coordination problems, and vision and hearing impairments.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'PVL'], 'uid': ''}
