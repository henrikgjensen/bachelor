Although acanthocytosis has been associated with a number of both inherited and acquired conditions, it is most commonly observed in abetalipoproteinemia and hemolytic anemia of severe liver disease.  The symptoms more commonly reported with acanthocytosis include a history of chronic diarrhea with pale, foul-smelling, and bulky stools; loss of appetite and vomiting; and slow weight gain and decreased growth.  Treatment for acanthocytosis depends on the underlying condition. ', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [], 'uid': ''}
