{'terms': '', 'desc': "Progressive supranuclear palsy is a movement disorder caused by damage to certain nerve cells in the brain. It affects brain cells that control the movement of the eyes. This leads to serious and permanent problems with balance and the way affected individuals walk. It usually occurs in middle-aged or elderly people. Symptoms are very different in each person, but may include personality changes, speech, vision and swallowing problems. Doctors sometimes confuse progressive supranuclear palsy with Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease. Progressive supranuclear palsy has no cure and no effective treatments.
