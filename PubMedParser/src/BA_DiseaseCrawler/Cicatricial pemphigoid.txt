Other mucosal sites that might be affected include the nasopharnyx, larynx, genitalia, rectum, and esophagus. The condition usually begins in late adulthood (e.g. 's or 's), affects more women than men, and has a variable prognosis. Scarring of the affected  mucosa of the eye may lead to blindness and tends to be the most feared complication. A combination of environmental and genetic factors appear to play a role in the susceptibility of developing benign mucosal pemphigoid. Although the specific causes of benign mucosal pemphigoid have not been identified, the condition is considered an autoimmune disease that is characterized by the production of autoantibodies against basement membrane zone antigens such as BP, BP, and laminin .  Treatment is dependent on the person's specific symptoms.", 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Benign mucosal pemphigoid', u'Benign mucous membrance pemphigoid'], 'uid': ''}
