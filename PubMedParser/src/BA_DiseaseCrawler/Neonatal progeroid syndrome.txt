{'terms': '', 'desc': "Wiedemann\xe2\x80\x93Rautenstrauch syndrome (WRS) is a premature aging syndrome in which features of human aging are apparent at birth, including larger than nomal sized head; prominent scalp veins; triangular, aged face; wrinkled skin; and decreased fat under the skin. This differentiates WRS from other premature aging syndromes such as Hutchinson\xe2\x80\x93Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) (more commonly called progeria) in which characteristics of premature aging typically become apparent some time after birth. Although the exact cause of WRS is unknown, it is believed to be genetic and inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Treatment is based on the individual's specific symptoms.", 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome', u'Progeroid syndrome', u' neonatal'], 'uid': u'264090'}
