This condition primarily affects the long bones and cartilage of the joints of the arms and legs, specifically the area where the shaft and head of a long bone meet (metaphyses). Clinical manifestations often appear in the first decade of life. The cause is unknown. There is no medical treatment, although surgery may be indicated in cases where complications (pathological fractures, growth defect, malignant transformation) arise.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Dyschondroplasia', u'Enchondromatosis', u'Multiple cartilaginous enchondroses', u'Multiple enchondromatosis'], 'uid': ''}
