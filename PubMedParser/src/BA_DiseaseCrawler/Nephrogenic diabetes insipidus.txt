{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a disorder in which a defect in the small tubes (tubules) in the kidneys causes a person to pass a large amount of urine. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when the kidney tubules, which allow water to be removed from the body or reabsorbed, do not respond to a chemical in the body called antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin. ADH normally tells the kidneys to make the urine more concentrated. As a result of the defect, the kidneys release an excessive amount of water into the urine, producing a large quantity of very dilute urine. Congenital diabetes insipidus is present at birth as a result of an inherited defect that usually affects men, although women can pass the gene on to their children. Most commonly, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus develops because of other reasons, as an acquired disorder.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Diabetes insipidus', u' nephrogenic', u' X-linked', u'Diabetes insipidus', u' nephrogenic', u' type 1'], 'uid': u'304800'}
