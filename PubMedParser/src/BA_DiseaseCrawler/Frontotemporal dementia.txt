{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Frontotemporal dementia describes a group of conditions associated with shrinking of the frontal and temporal anterior lobes of the brain. Symptoms include either variable changes in behavior (e.g., impulsive, bored, listless, lack of social contact, lack of empathy, distractibility, blunted emotions, compulsive behavior, decreased energy and motivation) or problems with language (e.g., difficulty making or understanding speech). Spatial skills and memory remain intact. There is a strong genetic component to the disease; it often runs in families. There is no cure for frontotemporal dementia at this time, as a result treatment remains supportive.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Dementia', u' frontotemporal', u' with parkinsonism', u'Frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism', u'Frontotemporal lobe dementia &#40;FLDEM&#41;', u'MSTD', u'Multiple system tauopathy with presenile dementia', u'FTD'], 'uid': u'600274'}
