{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is a rare, movement disorder characterized by a progressive degeneration of the nervous system (neurodegenerative disorder).  PKAN is generally separated into classic and atypical forms. Children with classic PKAN develop symptoms in the first ten years of life.  Children may initially be perceived as clumsy and later develop more noticeable problems with walking.  Most children lose the ability to walk independently between - years after the beginning of symptoms.  Individuals can also develop problems with speech (dysarthria), chewing, swallowing, and two thirds will develop retinal degeneration resulting in night blindness and loss of side (peripheral) vision. The atypical form of PKAN usually occurs after the age of ten and progresses more slowly.All individuals with PKAN have an abnormal buildup of iron in certain areas of the brain. A particular change, called the eye-of-the-tiger sign, which indicates an accumulation of iron, is typically seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain in people with this disorder.PKAN is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. PKAN is caused by changes (mutations) in the PANK gene. Medical therapy is centered on relieving associated symptoms.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'PKAN', u'Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation', u'NBIA', u'Neuroaxonal dystrophy', u' late infantile', u'Hallervorden-Spatz disease'], 'uid': u'234200'}
