{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are collections of small blood vessels (capillaries) in the central nervous system (CNS) that are enlarged and irregular in structure and take the shape of  a characteristic honeycomb-like pattern.  In CCM, the walls of the capillaries are thinner than normal, less elastic, and prone to leaking. Cavernous malformations can occur anywhere in the body, but usually only produce serious signs and symptoms when they are found in the brain and spinal cord. Approximately  percent of individuals with CCMs  will never experience any related medical problems.  Others will have serious symptoms such as seizures (most commonly), headaches, paralysis, hearing or vision changes, and bleeding in the brain (cerebral hemorrhage). The location and number of cerebral cavernous malformations determine the severity of this disorder. These malformations can change in size and number over time, but they do not become cancerous.  There are familial (inherited) and sporadic (occurring for no clear reason) cases of CCM.  Researchers have discovered three different genes associated with CCM.  Studies are currently underway to understand the relationship between the mutations of each of these genes and their corresponding symptoms.
