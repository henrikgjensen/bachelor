{'terms': '', 'desc': "Wolff Parkinson White syndrome is a condition characterized by abnormal electrical pathways in the heart that cause a disruption of the heart's normal rhythm (arrhythmia). People with this condition are born with an extra connection in the heart, called an accessory pathway. This extra connection can disrupt the coordinated movement of electrical signals through the heart, leading to an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) and other arrhythmias. In most cases, the cause of Wolff Parkinson White syndrome is unknown. A small percentage of cases are caused by mutations in the PRKAG gene. These cases appear to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
