The hereditary amyloidoses are characterized by the deposit of a specific type of protein called amyloid in multiple organs of the body where it should not be and, by its presence, the organ's tissue structure and function is disrupted. Each type of hereditary amyloidosis is the result of a mutation in a specific protein. However, the more common type of hereditary amyloidosis is transthyretin amyloidosis, a condition in which the amyloid deposits are most often made up of the transthyretin protein which is made in the liver. The signs and symptoms of transthyretin amyloidosis (A TTR) may include peripheral neuropathy; cardiomyopathy; or gastrointestinal, kidney, or eye problems. Other examples of hereditary amyloidosis include, but are not limited to, apolipoprotein AI amyloidosis (A ApoAI), gelsolin amyloidosis (A Gel), lysozyme amyloidosis (A Lys), cystatin C amyloidosis (A Cys), fibrinogen A&#;-chain amyloidosis (A Fib), and apolipoprotein AII amyloidosis (A ApoAII).", 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Familial amyloidosis'], 'uid': ''}
