{'terms': '', 'desc': 'WHIMS (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis syndrome) is a rare genetic immunodeficiency syndrome that can affect either boys or girls. Symptoms generally begin in childhood with frequent bacterial infections such as sinus infections (sinusitis), lung infections (bronchitis, pneumonia), oral and dental infections (sore throats, cavities, periodontitis), ear infections (otitis media), and skin infections (boils, abscesses, cellulitis). A low white blood count (particularly when patients are not infected) and low blood antibodies (immunoglobulins) may be recognized on routine testing or once a doctor realizes there is a pattern of repeated infection. In later childhood, skin and mucosal warts often develop and become persistent despite treatments that are normally effective. Warts that involve the genital area may eventually cause cancer. Frequent bacterial infections can cause severe problems with loss of hearing, teeth, or lung function. Medicines that replace antibodies (immunoglobulins), medicines that increase the number of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell), vaccinations, and preventative antibiotics are often used to reduce the chance of infections, but there is currently no specific treatment for this disorder.WHIMS is caused by genetic changes (mutations) that increase the function of an immune system receptor called CXC chemokine receptor  (CXCR). If a parent has a CXCR mutation, there is a % chance that the changed gene will pass to a child; only a single copy is needed to cause disease (autosomal dominant transmission). Thus, in this disease, more than one family member is often affected.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Warts', u' Hypogamma-globulinemia', u' Infections', u' and Myelokathexis', u'WHIM syndrome'], 'uid': u'193670'}
