A mutation is a change in a gene from its natural state. The factor V Leiden gene mutation can cause thrombophilia, or an increased tendency to form abnormal blood clots in blood vessels. People who have the factor V Leiden mutation are at somewhat higher than average risk for a type of clot that forms in large veins in the legs (deep venous thrombosis, or DVT) or a clot that travels through the bloodstream and lodges in the lungs (pulmonary embolism, or PE).', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Activated Protein C Resistance', u'APC resistance', u' Leiden type', u'Hereditary resistance to activated protein C'], 'uid': ''}
