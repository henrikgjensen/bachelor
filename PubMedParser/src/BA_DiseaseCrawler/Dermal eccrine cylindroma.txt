They most commonly occur on the head and neck and rarely become cancerous (malignant). "Dermal" indicates that these tumors are found on the skin. An eccrine gland is a type of simple sweat gland that is found in almost all regions of the skin.  Solitary cylindromas occur sporadically and typically are not inherited. They usually begin to form during mid-adulthood as a slow-growing, rubbery nodule that causes no symptoms. The development of multiple cylindromas can be hereditary and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.  Individuals with the inherited form begin to develop numerous, rounded nodules of various size shortly after puberty. The tumors grow very slowly and increase in number over time.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [], 'uid': ''}
