{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Orofaciodigital syndrome (OFDS) type  is a genetic condition that was first described in  by Mohr. OFDS type  belongs to a group of disorders called orofaciodigital syndromes (OFDS) characterized by mouth malformations, unique facial findings, and abnormalities of the fingers and/or toes. Other organs might be affected in OFDS, defining the specific types. OFDS type  is very similar to oral-facial-digital syndrome (OFDS) type . However, the following are not found in OFDS type : () absence of hair and skin abnormalities; () presence of more than one fused big toe on each foot; () involvement of the central nervous system; and () heart malformations. Although it is known that OFDS type  is genetic, the exact gene that causes the syndrome has not been identified. The condition is believed to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Treatment is based on the symptoms present in the patient.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'OFD2', u'OFD syndrome 2', u'Oral-facial-digital syndrome type 2', u'Mohr syndrome'], 'uid': u'252100'}
