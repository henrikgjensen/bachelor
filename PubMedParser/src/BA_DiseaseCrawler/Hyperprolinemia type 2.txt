{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Hyperprolinemia type  results in an excess of a particular protein building block (amino acid), called proline, in the blood. This condition generally occurs when proline is not broken down properly by the body. Hyperprolinemia type  causes proline levels in the blood to be  to  times higher than normal, and it also causes high levels of a related compound called pyrroline--carboxylate. Some people with this condition develop mild mental retardation and seizures; however, the symptoms of this disorder vary in severity among affected individuals.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'1 alpha pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase deficiency', u'Type 2 hyperprolinemia', u'Hyperprolinemia type 2'], 'uid': u'239510'}
