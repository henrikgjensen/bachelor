Attacks often occur weeks or months after the onset of excessive daytime sleepiness. Duration and severity of attacks vary from, barely perceptible, momentary loss of muscle tone to complete loss of tone in all voluntary muscles leading to total physical collapse. People with this condition remain fully conscious during episodes. Episodes are often triggered by sudden, strong, emotions such as fear, anger, stress, excitement, or humor (laughter).', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Cataleptic attacks'], 'uid': ''}
