This condition is characterized by mild to moderate mental retardation or learning disabilities, unique personality characteristics, distinctive facial features, and heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems. Williams syndrome is caused by missing genes from a specific region of chromosome . The deleted region includes more than  genes and researchers believe that a loss of several of these genes probably contributes to the characteristic features of this disorder.
