At birth, babies with PWS have poor muscle tone and a weak cry.  Initially they are slow feeders and appear undernourished. The feeding problems improve after infancy and often between  to  years of age, children with PWS become very focused on food and have difficulty controlling their appetite. The overeating often results in rapid weight gain and obesity. Individuals with PWS also often have developmental delays and less-than-average adult height. There are several known genetic mechanisms that can cause Prader-Willi syndrome; all of the mechanisms cause missing or non-working genes on chromosome .  Most cases are not inherited, but occur randomly.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'PWS', u'Willi-Prader syndrome', u'Prader Labhart Willi syndrome', u'Obesity', u' muscular hypotonia', u' mental retardation', u' short stature', u' hypogonadotropic hypogonadism', u' and small hands and feet'], 'uid': ''}
