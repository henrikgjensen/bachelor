{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Notalgia paresthetica is a common chronic, localized itch, that usually affects patches of skin on the upper back, but can occacionally be more widespread and involve other parts of the back, the shoulders and upper chest. People feel part itch, and part paresthesia (a sensation of tingling, pricking, or numbness of the skin).  There are no signs on the skin except for signs of chronic scratching and rubbing.  Amyloid deposits (a collection of a specific type of protein) may be found in skin biopsies, but this is thought to be a secondary event.  The cause of the itch in notalgia paresthetica may be due to the compression of spinal nerves by bones or muscles as the nerves emerge through the vertebrae to the back muscles.  Sometimes degenerative changes in the area of the verterbrae that innervate the affected back muscles can be seen, but not always.  Symptoms of notalgia paresthetica may respond to topical capsaicin treatment.', 'db': 'pubmed', 'syn': [], 'uid': u'tinyurl.com/6apwo5'}
