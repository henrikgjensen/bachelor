These conditions often cause fixed muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, cramps, pain, and myoglobinuria. The muscle cramps are sharp contractions that may seem to temporarily lock the muscles. The pain is caused by a process of sudden muscle breakdown that leads to the loss of myoglobin from the muscles into the urine (myoglobinuria).\n', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [], 'uid': ''}
