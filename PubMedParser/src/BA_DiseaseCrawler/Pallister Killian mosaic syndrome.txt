{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome is a disorder that is characterized by extremely weak muscle tone (hypotonia) in infancy and early childhood, intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, sparse hair, areas of unusual skin coloring (pigmentation), and other birth defects. The signs and symptoms of the Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome can vary, although most documented cases of people with the syndrome have severe to profound intellectual disability and other serious health problems. Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome is usually caused by the presence of an abnormal extra chromosome  called isochromosome p. Normal chromosomes have one long (q) arm and one short (p) arm, but isochromosomes have either two q arms or two p arms. Isochromosome p is a version of chromosome  made up of two p arms. Cells normally have two copies of each chromosome, one inherited from each parent. In people with Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome, cells have the two usual copies of chromosome , but some cells also have the isochromosome p. These cells have a total of four copies of all the genes on the p arm of chromosome . The extra genetic material from the isochromosome disrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features of this disorder. Although Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome is usually caused by an isochromosome p, other, more complex chromosomal changes involving chromosome  are responsible for the disorder in rare cases.
