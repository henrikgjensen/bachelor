{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Jejunal atresia is a genetic disorder in which people are born missing part of the fold of the stomach membrane that connects the small intestine to the back wall of the abdomen. As a result, one of the three portions of the small intestine (the jejunum) twists around one of the arteries of the colon called the marginal artery and causes a blockage (atresia). Jejunal atresia is the most common cause of bowel obstruction in the newborn. The defect may occur alone (isolated) or with other birth defects.  The symptoms and treatment vary from patient to patient.
