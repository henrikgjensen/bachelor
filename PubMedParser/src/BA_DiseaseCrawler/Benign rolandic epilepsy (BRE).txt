It is referred to as "benign" because most children outgrow the condition by puberty, usually by  years of age.   This form of epilepsy is characterized by seizures involving the part of the frontal lobe of the brain called the rolandic area. The seizures associated with this condition typically occur during the nighttime.   Treatment is usually not prescribed, since the condition tends to disappear by puberty.
