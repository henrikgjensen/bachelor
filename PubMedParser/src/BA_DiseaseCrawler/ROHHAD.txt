{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysregulation, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) is a newly described syndrome that can cause cardiorespiratory arrests and death. As the name suggests, the most characteristic manifestions include rapid-onset obesity in the first  years of life, followed by hypothalamic dysfunction and then onset of symptoms of autonomic dysregulation (impairment of the autonomic nervous system) with later onset of alveolar hypoventilation (reduced lung function). The cause of this syndrome, once known as late-onset central hypoventilation syndrome with hypothalamic dysfunction (LO-CHS/HD), is unknown. Although there is no cure for this condition at this time, early diagnosis and proper management may help to avoid catastrophic consequences.
