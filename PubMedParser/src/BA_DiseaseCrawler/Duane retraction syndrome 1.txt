{'terms': '', 'desc': "Duane syndrome is a congenital (present from birth) eye movement disorder. It is a miswiring of the eye muscles, causing some eye muscles to contract when they shouldn't and other eye muscles not to contract when they should. People with Duane syndrome have a limited ability to move the eye outward toward the ear (abduction) and, in most cases, a limited ability to move the eye inward toward the nose (adduction). Often, when the eye moves toward the nose, the eyeball also pulls into the socket (retraction), the eye opening narrows and, in some cases, the eye will move upward or downward. The syndrome is classified into three types based on the presence of a defect in adduction, abduction or both. Most cases are sporadic, however familial occurrence with autosomal dominant inheritance has been reported.", 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Duane syndrome', u'DRS', u'Duane anomaly', u'DUS', u'Retraction syndrome', u'DURS1'], 'uid': u'126800'}
