{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Alpha -antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder that can cause lung disease in adults and liver disease in adults and children. Alpha- antitrypsin (AAT) is a protein that protects the lungs. The liver usually makes the protein, and releases it into the bloodstream. Because of a problem with the  SERPINA gene, some people have little or no AAT. Not having enough AAT may lead to emphysema or liver problems. Smoking increases the risk. A deficiency of AAT can be treated but not cured. One treatment involves adding to or replacing the missing protein. More severe cases may require a lung transplant.
