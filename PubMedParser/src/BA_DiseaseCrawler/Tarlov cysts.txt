These cysts can compress nerve roots, causing lower back pain, sciatica (shock-like or burning pain in the lower back, buttocks, and down one leg to below the knee), urinary incontinence, headaches, sexual dysfunction, constipation, and some loss of feeling or control of movement in the leg and/or foot. Pressure on the nerves next to the cysts can also cause pain and deterioration of the surrounding bone. Tarlov cysts may become symptomatic following shock, trauma, or exertion that causes the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid. Women are at much higher risk of developing these cysts than are men.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Sacral Tarlov cysts', u'Sacral perineural cysts', u'Tarlov cyst', u'Perineural cysts', u'Sacral neural cysts'], 'uid': ''}
