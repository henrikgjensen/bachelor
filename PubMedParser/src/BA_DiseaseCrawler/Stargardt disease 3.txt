{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Stargardt disease is one of the most frequent causes of macular degeneration in childhood. The progressive vision loss associated with Stargardt disease is caused by the death of photoreceptor cells in the central portion of the retina called the macula. Decreased central vision is a hallmark of Stargardt disease. Side (peripheral) vision is usually preserved. Stargardt disease  results from mutation in the gene encoding elongation of very long chain fatty acids- (ELOVL). It is most often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. At present there is no cure for Stargardt disease and there is very little that can be done to slow its progression. Wearing sunglasses to protect the eyes from ultra-violet (UV) and bright light may be of some benefit. For people who already have significant vision loss, low vision aides are available.
