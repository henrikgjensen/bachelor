{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Leigh syndrome is a degenerative neurological condition, marked by almost identical brain changes (e.g., focal, bilaterally, symmetric lesions in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem).  There exist variability in the symptoms and genetic causes of Leigh syndrome. The symptoms vary from severe neurologic abnormalities to a near absence of abnormalities. Most often, the central nervous system is affected, resulting in developmental delay and regression, seizures, nystagmus,ophthalmoplegia, optic atrophy,ataxia, hypotonia, spasticity, and breathing abnormalities. Cases in which neurological function is near normal are very rare. In general, the symptoms of Leigh syndrome develop during childhood; however, in some rare cases, symptoms do not begin until adolescence or adulthood. Leigh syndrome can be caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'LS', u'Subacute necrotizing encephalopathy', u'SNE', u'Necrotizing encephalopathy', u' infantile subacute', u' of Leigh', u'Leigh&#39;s necrotizing encephalopathy', u'Leigh&#39;s disease'], 'uid': u'256000'}
