{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a disorder of tooth development. This condition causes teeth to be discolored (most often a blue-gray or yellow-brown color) and translucent. Teeth are also weaker than normal, making them prone to rapid wear, breakage, and loss. These problems can affect both primary (baby) teeth and permanent teeth. Dentinogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the DSPP gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.\n', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Opalescent dentin', u'Dentinogenesis imperfecta without osteogenesis imperfecta', u'Opalescent teeth without osteogenesis imperfecta', u'Dentinogenesis imperfecta', u' Shields type 2', u'DGI 1'], 'uid': u'125490'}
