{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Type A (CMTA) is a type of inherited neurological disorder that affects the peripheral nerves. Affected individuals experience weakness and wasting (atrophy) of the muscles of the lower legs beginning in adolescence; later they experience hand weakness and sensory loss. CMTA is caused by having an extra copy (duplication) of the PMP gene. This gene provides the instructions for producing a protein called peripheral myelin protein-, which is an important component of the myelin sheath. The duplication of this gene results in an overabundance of peripheral myelin protein-, causing the structure and function of the myelin sheath to be abnormal. CMTA is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment for this condition involves physical therapy, occupational therapy, braces and other orthopedic devices, orthopedic surgery, and pain-killing drugs.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease', u' demyelinating', u' type 1A', u'CMT 1A', u'Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A', u'HMSN 1A', u'Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1A'], 'uid': u'118220'}
