The disorder usually occurs in the gastrointestinal system, but may affect any part of the body including the heart, lungs, brain, joints, and eyes. In the gastrointestinal system it interferes with the body's ability to absorb certain nutrients. This leads to a condition known as malabsorption. Whipple disease causes weight loss, incomplete breakdown of carbohydrates or fats, and malfunctions of the immune system. It is caused by infection from bacteria called Tropheryma whippelii. When recognized and treated, Whipple disease can usually be cured. Untreated, the disease may be fatal.
