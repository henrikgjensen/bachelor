Upper motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord deliver signals to the lower motor neurons which in turn, carry messages to the muscles. In HSP, upper motor neurons slowly degenerate so the muscles do not receive the correct messages causing progressive spasticity (increased muscle tone/stiffness) and weakness of the legs leading to difficulty walking.  As degeneration continues, symptoms worsen. ', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'HSP', u'Familial spastic paraparesis', u'FSP'], 'uid': ''}
