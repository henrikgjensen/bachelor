{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal  (CLN) / late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL) / Jansky-Bielschowsky / late infantile CLN/TPP disorder is part of a group of progressive degenerative neurometabolic disorders known as the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). The NCLs are characterized by an abnormal accumulation of lipopigments, which are substances made up of fats and proteins within the brain\xe2\x80\x99s nerve cells, eyes, skin, muscle, and other tissues throughout the body. CLN causes nerve cells, found in the brain, retina, and central nervous system, to die. Symptoms typically begin between ages  and . Early signs may include loss of muscle coordination (ataxia) and seizures that do not respond to drugs. This form progresses rapidly and ends in death between ages  and . The condition is caused by mutations in the CLN  gene which lead to deficient activity of the TPP enzyme.
