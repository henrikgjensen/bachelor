{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency is a condition that prevents the body from converting certain fats called long-chain fatty acids into energy, particularly during periods without food. Carnitine, a natural substance acquired mostly through the diet, is required by cells to process fats and produce energy. Symptoms of this condition include low level of keytones and low blood sugar (hypoketotic hypoglycemia), which can result in a loss of consciousness or seizures. People with this disorder typically also have an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), muscle weakness, nervous system damage, and elevated levels of carnitine in the blood. It is caused by mutations in the CPTA gene.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A deficiency', u'CPT1A deficiency', u'Hepatic CPT1', u'Hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 deficiency', u'L-CPT 1 deficiency'], 'uid': u'255120'}
