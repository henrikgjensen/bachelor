The characteristic features are learning difficulties, often a consequence of communication problems (speech delay, poor writing skills), and overactivity. Fragile XE syndrome is caused by a specific type of change (mutation) called a trinucleotide repeat expansion that occurs on chromosome X. The repeating trinucleotide in Fragile XE syndrome is CCG. When the number of CCG repeats is over , people typically have the signs and symptoms seen in Fragile XE syndrome.
