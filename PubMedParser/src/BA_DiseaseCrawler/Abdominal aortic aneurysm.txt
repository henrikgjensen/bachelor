Aneurysms develop slowly over many years and often have no symptoms. If an aneurysm expands rapidly, tears open (ruptured aneurysm), or blood leaks along the wall of the vessel (aortic dissection), symptoms may develop suddenly. Symptoms may include abdominal pain or rigidity, nausea, vomiting, rapid heart rate, and/or clammy skin. The exact cause of abdominal aortic aneurysms is unknown, but they are most often seen in males over  who have one or more of the following risk factors: emphysema, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, or a history of smoking. Genetics may also play a role. If the aneurysm is small and there are no symptoms, periodic evaluation may be recommended. Aneurysms that cause symptoms usually require surgery to prevent complications. The goal of surgery is to prevent complications or symptoms from developing.
