In this condition the small blood vessels of the brain (microangiopathy), retina (vascular retinopathy), and kidneys are affected resulting in progressive adult-on-set vision loss, psychiatric disturbance, stroke-like episodes, neurologic decline, and in some cases kidney disease. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The causative gene mutation has not yet been identified.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'HERNS'], 'uid': ''}
