Individuals with IRAK- deficiency seem to be particularly susceptible to infections caused by bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. The deficiency is caused by mutations in a gene called IRAK (interleukin  receptor-associated kinase ).   The IRAK gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is crucial for protective immunity against specific bacterial infections.
