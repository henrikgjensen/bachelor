This process generally becomes noticeable in early childhood, starting with the neck and shoulders and proceeding down the body and into the limbs. FOP is caused by mutations in the ACVR gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from new mutations in the gene. At this time, there is no teatment for FOP.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'FOP'], 'uid': ''}
