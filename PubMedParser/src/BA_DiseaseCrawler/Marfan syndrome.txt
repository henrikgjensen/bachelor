{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Marfan syndrome is a disorder of the connective tissue. Connective tissue provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body such as bones, ligaments, muscles, walls of blood vessels, and heart valves. Marfan syndrome affects most organs and tissues, especially the skeleton, lungs, eyes, heart, and the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). Marfan syndrome is sometimes classified as type I or type II, although this classification system is not universally accepted. When used, type I or classic Marfan syndrome refers to the most common form of this disorder, characterized by the features described above. Type II Marfan syndrome is less common. It is similar to classic Marfan syndrome except eye problems (such as ectopia lentis) are absent, and the genetic cause is different.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Marfanoid hypermobility syndrome', u'Marfan syndrome type 1', u'Contractural arachnodactyly', u'Increased height', u' long limbs &#38; digits', u' chest deformity', u' joint laxity', u' scoliosis ', u'thoracic lordosis', u'a highly arched palate with crowding of teeth'], 'uid': u'154700'}
