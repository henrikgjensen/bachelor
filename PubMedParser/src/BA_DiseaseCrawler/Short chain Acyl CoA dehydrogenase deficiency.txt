This condition belongs to a group of disorders known as fatty acid oxidation disorders (FOD). SCAD deficiency is caused by the lack of an enzyme known as short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which is involved in the breakdown of short-chain fatty acids. When not enough of this enzyme is present, excessive amounts of fatty acids and ammonia accumulate in the body. The symptoms of SCAD deficiency include a lack of energy, poor growth, and developmental delay. Treatment for this condition typically includes a low-fat diet and avoidance of long periods without food (fasting).', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'SCAD deficiency', u'ACADS deficiency', u'SCADH deficiency', u'Lipid-storage myopathy secondary to short chain Acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency'], 'uid': ''}
