{'terms': '', 'desc': "Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic disease that causes the bile ducts in the liver to become inflamed and damaged. When the bile ducts become damaged from chronic inflammation, bile builds up in the liver, injuring liver tissue. Injured liver tissue from chronic inflammation and the buildup of bile leads to cirrhosis, a condition in which the liver slowly deteriorates and malfunctions. Scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue, partially blocking the flow of blood through the liver. In addition to bile duct and liver damage, people with primary biliary cirrhosis are likely to have other metabolic or immune system disorders, including: thyroid disease, CREST syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon, and rheumatoid arthritis.", 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'PBC', u'Familial primary biliary cirrhosis'], 'uid': u'109720'}
