It develops in nerve tissue associated with the sense of smell and can occur in people of any age. This cancer is very uncommon, accounting for  percent of all cancers of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Although it generally grows slowly, an esthesioneuroblastoma can sometimes grow very quickly. Fast-growing tumors can metastasize (spread) even many years after treatment of the initial tumor.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Olfactory neuroblastoma'], 'uid': ''}
