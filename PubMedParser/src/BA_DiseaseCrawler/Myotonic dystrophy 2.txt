The condition is characterized by prolonged muscle tensing (myotonia) as well as muscle weakness, pain, and stiffness. Signs and symptoms of myotonic dystrophy usually develop when a person is in his or her twenties or thirties. The muscles typically affected are those in the neck, fingers, elbows, and hips. Facial and ankle may also be affected, but are less commonly involved. The severity of myotonic dystrophy type  varies widely among those who have it, even among family members.  The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is caused by mutations in the CNBP gene. Treatment is based on the individual's specific signs and symptoms.
