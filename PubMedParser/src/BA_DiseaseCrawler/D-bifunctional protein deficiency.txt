{'terms': '', 'desc': 'D-bifunctional enzyme deficiency (sometimes referred to as pseudo-Zellweger syndrome) is a genetic disorder typically characterized by hypotonia (low muscle tone) and seizures within the first month of life, vision and hearing problems, distinct facial features, and developmental delay. Some children with D-bifunctional enzyme deficiency also go on to develop liver disease and/or a progressive leukodystrophy. Most people who have D-bifunctional enzyme deficiency pass within the first  years of life; however, there have been a few reported cases of patients living beyond  years of life. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. D-bifunctional enzyme deficiency is caused by mutations in the HSDB gene and is believed to be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.
