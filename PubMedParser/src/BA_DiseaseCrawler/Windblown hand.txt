People with windblown hand have flexion contractures of the joints at the base of each finger that prevents normal mobility of their hand and causes their fingers to bend toward their "little" finger (i.e., ulnar drift). In addition, windblown hand is characterized by a "thumb-in-palm deformity" or "clasped thumb" where the thumb is webbed to the palm by a soft tissue bridge.
