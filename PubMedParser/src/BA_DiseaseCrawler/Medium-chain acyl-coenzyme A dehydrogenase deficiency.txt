{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is an inherited metabolic condition that prevents the body from converting certain fats to energy, particularly during periods without food (fasting). Normally, through a process called fatty acid oxidation, several enzymes work in a step-wise fashion to break down (metabolize) fats and convert them to energy. People with MCAD deficiency have inadequate levels of an enzyme required for the step that metabolizes a group of fats called medium-chain fatty acids. Mutations in the ACADM gene cause MCAD deficiency.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'MCAD deficiency', u'Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase', u' medium chain', u' deficiency of', u'MCADH deficiency', u'ACADM deficiency', u'MCADD', u'Medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency', u'Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency'], 'uid': u'201450'}
