{'terms': '', 'desc': 'McCune-Albright syndrome is a disease that affects the bones, skin, and several hormone-producing (endocrine) tissues. This multisystem disorder is characterized by: replacement of normal bone tissue with areas of abnormal fibrous growth (fibrous dysplasia); patches of abnormal skin pigmentation (i.e., areas of light-brown skin cafe-au-lait spots with jagged borders); and abnormalities in the glands that regulate the body\xe2\x80\x99s rate of growth, its sexual development, and certain other metabolic functions (multiple endocrine dysfunction). This condition results from a change (or mutation) in a gene that occurs by chance in the womb. Because it occurs by chance, it is not inherited and passed down from one generation to the next.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'MAS', u'Albright syndrome', u'Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia', u'PFD', u'POFD'], 'uid': u'174800'}
