{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Schizencephaly is a developmental birth defect. It is characterized by abnormal slits or clefts in the cerebral hemispheres of the brain.  People with clefts in both hemispheres commonly have developmental delays, delays in speech and language skills, seizures, and problems with brain-spinal cord communication.  Individuals with clefts in only one hemisphere are often paralyzed on one side of the body, may have seizures, and may have average to near-average intelligence.  Other signs and symptoms of schizencephaly may include an abnormally small head, hydrocephalus, mental retardation, partial or complete paralysis, or poor muscle tone.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Familial schizencephaly'], 'uid': u'269160'}
