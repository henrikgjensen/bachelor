{'terms': u'(saethre-chotzen%5btitle%5d+and+syndrome%5btitle%5d)+and+hasabstract%5btext%5d', 'desc': 'Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by the premature fusion of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis). This early fusion prevents the skull from growing normally and affects the shape of the head and face. The signs and symptoms of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome vary widely, even among affected individuals in the same family. Mutations in the TWIST gene cause Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases may result from new mutations in the gene.
