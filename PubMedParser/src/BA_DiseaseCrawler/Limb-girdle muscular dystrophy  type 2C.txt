{'terms': '', 'desc': "Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type C (LGMDC) is a condition that affects the muscles and is caused by mutations in the gamma-sarcoglycan gene. This condition belongs to a group of muscle disorders called limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, which are characterized by progressive loss of muscle bulk and symmetrical weakening of voluntary muscles, primarily those in the shoulders and around the hips. LGMDC is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and treatment is based on an individual's symptoms.", 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy with gamma-sarcoglycan deficiency', u'Gamma-sarcoglycanopathy', u'LGMD2C', u'Muscular dystrophy', u' Duchenne-like', u'Duchenne-like muscular dystrophy', u' autosomal recessive', u' type 1', u'DMDA1', u'Adhalin deficiency', u' secondary', u'DMDA', u'Severe childhood autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy', u' North African type', u'Maghrebian myopathy'], 'uid': u'253700'}
