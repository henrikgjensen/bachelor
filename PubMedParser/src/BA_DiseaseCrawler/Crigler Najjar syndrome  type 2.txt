The gene mutation causes the body to be unable to make adequate enzyme to convert bilirubin into a form that can easily be removed from the body. Without this enzyme, bilirubin can build up in the body and lead to extraordinarily yellow skin and eyes (jaundice). This condition is less severe than the type  form, however the severity of type II can vary greatly. Almost all patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II develop normally, but there is a risk for some neurologic damage from kernicterus (bilirubin accumulation in the brain). In general people with type II Crigler Najjar syndrome have serum bilirubin levels ranging from  to  mg/dL. Phenobarbital treatment is the standard therapy for this condition and can often help to drastically reduce the bilirubin levels.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Mutation in the UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase gene'], 'uid': ''}
