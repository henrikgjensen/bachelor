{'terms': '', 'desc': "Ewing's sarcoma is a malignant (cancerous) bone tumor that affects children. It can occur any time during childhood and young adulthood, but usually develops during puberty, when bones are growing rapidly. The tumor may arise anywhere in the body, usually in the long bones of the arms and legs, the pelvis, or the chest. It may also develop in the skull or the flat bones of the trunk. There are few symptoms. The most common is pain and occasionally swelling at the site of the tumor. Fever may also be present. The tumor often spreads (metastasis) to the lungs and other bones. The cause of Ewing's sarcoma is unknown.", 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Ewing&#39;s tumor', u'Sarcoma', u' Ewing&#39;s', u'Ewing sarcoma', u'Ewing tumor', u'ES'], 'uid': u'612219'}
