Cutis verticis gyrata is classified according to the underlying cause as primary essential, primary nonessential and secondary. The cause of the primary forms is unknown. Primary essential cutis verticis gyrata has no other associated abnormalities. The primary nonessential form can be associated with mental deficiency, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, schizophrenia, cranial abnormalities (microcephaly), deafness, ophthalmologic abnormalities (cataract, strabismus, blindness, retinitis pigmentosa), or a combination of these. Secondary cases of cutis verticis gyrata are associated with a number of underlying diseases which cause changes in the structure of the scalp.
