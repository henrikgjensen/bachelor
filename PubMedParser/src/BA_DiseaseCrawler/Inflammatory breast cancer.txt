This type of breast cancer is called \xe2\x80\x9cinflammatory\xe2\x80\x9d because the breast often looks swollen and red, or \xe2\x80\x9cinflamed.\xe2\x80\x9d  There may be no abnormality on amammogram beyond skin thickening, and a lump in the breast may not be felt.  It is crucial to identify the warning signs and clinical symptoms of IBC because a prompt diagnosis and early management can signficantly improve the outcome.  With the advent of multimodality treatments including primary systemic chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy, approximately one-third of individuals diagnosed with IBC will become long-term survivors.   Like other types of breast cancer, IBC can occur in men, but usually at an older age than in women. Some studies have shown an association between family history of breast cancer and IBC, but more studies are needed to draw firm conclusions .', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Breast cancer', u' inflammatory'], 'uid': ''}
