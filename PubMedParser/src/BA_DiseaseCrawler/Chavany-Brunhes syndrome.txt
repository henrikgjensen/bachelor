Attacks of headache may be precipitated by fatigue, emotional stress, or maintaining a fixed position of the head for a prolonged period of time. Mental retardation occurs in some cases, which may also be called Fritsche\xe2\x80\x99s disease. The cause of this condition is unknown, but may be familial, cause by an autosomal recessive gene. Chavany-Brunhes syndrome is more commonly known as Fahr's disease or familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification.
