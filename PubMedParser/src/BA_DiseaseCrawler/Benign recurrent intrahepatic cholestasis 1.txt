{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type  (BRIC-) is a mild form of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type  (PFIC-). It is characterized by recurrent episodes of cholestasis, severe pruritus, and jaundice. Episodes may last from weeks to months. Symptom-free intervals may last from months to years. Although chronic liver damage typically does not develop, some cases of BRIC- may progress to a form that is indistinguishable from PFIC-. BRIC- is caused by mutations in the aminophospholipid transporter ATPB (FIC gene) on chromosome q-. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. There is no cure for BRIC-. Therapy is supportive and aimed at relieving pruritus and other complications of severe cholestasis until the episode resolves spontaneously.
