{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Chondrodysplasia punctata , X-linked recessive (CDPX) is a genetic disorder present from birth that affects bone and cartilage development. On x-ray, affected infants have characteristic spots at the ends of their bones. These spots are called chondrodysplasia punctata or stippled epiphyses and typically disappear between age  and . Additional common features of CDPX are shortened fingers and a flat nose. Some people with this condition have breathing abnormalities, hearing loss, abnormalities of the spinal bones in the neck, and delayed intellectual development. CDPX is caused by changes in the ARSE gene, which is located on the X chromosome. This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner and occurs almost exclusively in males. Most affected individuals have a normal lifespan, although some individuals experience complications that can be life-threatening.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Chondrodysplasia punctata 1 X-linked recessive', u'CDPX1', u'CPXR', u'Arylsulfatase E deficiency', u'Chondrodysplasia punctata', u' brachytelephalangic', u'Chondrodysplasia punctata brachytelephalangic'], 'uid': u'302950'}
