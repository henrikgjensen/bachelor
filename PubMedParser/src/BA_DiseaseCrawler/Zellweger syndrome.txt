{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Zellweger syndrome is the severe form of spectrum of conditions that fall on the peroxisome biogenesis disorders, Zellweger syndrome spectrum.  Peroxisome biogenesis disorders are a group of conditions in which the process of making peroxisomes (specialized structures in the cell responsible for a variety of metabolic processes) does not work properly. The signs and symptoms of Zellweger syndrome typically appear during the newborn period and include poor muscle tone (hypotonia), poor feeding, seizures, cysts in the liver, affected liver functioning, and characteristic facial features. The prognosis for Zellweger syndrome is usually poor, with most children passing during the first year of life. Those children with Zellweger syndrome that live past one year of age generally have retinal dystrophy (degeneration of a light-sensitive tissue located in the back of the eye), sensorineural hearing loss, developmental delay with hypotonia, and liver dysfunction. Zellweger syndrome is caused by mutations in the twelve different PEX genes; however, mutations in the PEX gene are the most common and have been reported to affect close to  percent of people who have Zellweger syndrome. Zellweger syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, which means a person must inherit two mutated copies of the PEX gene-one from each parent-to have the syndrome.No cure is available for Zellweger syndrome. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Cerebrohepatorenal syndrome', u'CHR', u'ZWS', u'ZS', u'Zellweger leukodystrophy'], 'uid': u'214100'}
