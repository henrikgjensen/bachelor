{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deaminase deficiency is a condition that can affect the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). People with this condition do not make enough of an enzyme called AMP deaminase. Mutations in the AMPD gene cause AMP deaminase deficiency. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Researchers have proposed three types of AMP deaminase deficiency (inherited type, acquired type, and coincidental inherited type), which are distinguished by their symptoms and genetic cause.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'AMP deaminase 1 deficiency', u'Myoadenylate deaminase deficiency'], 'uid': u'102770'}
