{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Lafora disease is an inherited progressive myoclonus epilepsy which most commonly starts as epileptic seizures in adolescence. Most cases of Lafora disease are caused by mutations in one of two known genes: EMPA and EMPB. Both genes are located on chromosome  and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. A few cases of Lafora disease are caused by an as yet unidentified gene(s). Lafora disease causes seizures, muscle spasms, difficulty walking, dementia, and eventually death. There is currently no therapy that has proven effective against disease progression. Therapy is primarily palliative and aimed at reducing seizures.
