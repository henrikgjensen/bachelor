Signs and symptoms usually develop in adulthood and include ventricular arrhythmia that can cause fainting, seizures, difficulty breathing, or sudden death. These complications typically occur when an affected person is resting or asleep. The underlying cause of Brugada syndrome can not always be identified. In some cases it is due to mutations in the SCNA gene. Other cases are not genetic (are not due to a gene mutation), but acquired due to adverse reactions to drugs or associated with very low or high levels of potassium, or high levels of calcium.", 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Right bundle branch block', u' ST segment elevation', u' and sudden death syndrome', u'Sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome'], 'uid': ''}
