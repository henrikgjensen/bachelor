{'terms': '', 'desc': 'X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is an inherited disorder that occurs most often in males. It mainly affects the nervous system and the adrenal glands (small glands located on top of each kidney). People with this disorder often have progressive destruction of the fatty covering (myelin) that insulates nerves in the brain and spinal cord. They may also have a shortage of certain hormones caused by damage to the outer layer of the adrenal glands (adrenal cortex), called adrenocortical insufficiency. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is caused by mutations in the ABCD gene. There are three distinct types of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy: a childhood cerebral form, an adrenomyeloneuropathy type, and a type called Addison disease. A specific treatment for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is not currently available, but eating a diet low in very-long-chain fatty acids and taking special oils can lower the blood levels of very-long-chain fatty acids. Bone marrow transplant is being tested as an experimental treatment.', 'db': 'pubmed', 'syn': [u'ALD - X-linked'], 'uid': ''}
