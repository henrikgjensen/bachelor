{'terms': u'canomad%5ball+fields%5d', 'desc': 'CANOMAD syndrome is a rare chronic immune-mediated demyelinating polyneuropathy. CANOMAD stands for Chronic Ataxic Neuropathy Ophtalmoplegia IgM paraprotein Cold Agglutinins Disialosyl antibodies. Signs and symptoms of CANOMAD may include loss of muscle, tendon, and joint sensation, abnormal gait (walk), ataxia, tingling sensation on the skin around the mouth or extremities, paralysis of eye muscles, difficulty swallowing and speaking, and rarely respiratory muscle weakness. This condition is caused by the presence of anti-diasialosyl antibodies in the body.  Oral or intravenous corticosteroids, \xc3\x9f-interferons, plasma exchange, intravenous immunoglobulin, and cytotoxic drugs have all been used in treating CANOMAD with limited success.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Chronic Ataxic Neuropathy Ophthalmoplegia M-protein Agglutination Disialosyl antibodies syndrome', u'Chronic sensory ataxic neuropathy with anti-disialosyl antibodies'], 'uid': ''}
