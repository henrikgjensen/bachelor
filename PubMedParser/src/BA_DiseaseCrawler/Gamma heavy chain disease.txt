Antibodies are made up of light chains and heavy chains. In this disorder, the heavy chain of the gamma antibody (IgG) is overproduced by the body.  Gamma heavy chain disease mainly affects older adults and is similar to aggressive malignant (cancerous) lymphoma. However, some people with this disorder have no symptoms. Approximately one-third of individuals with gamma heavy chain disease are also diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'IgG heavy chain disease', u'Franklin disease', u'Gamma heavy chain deposition disease'], 'uid': ''}
