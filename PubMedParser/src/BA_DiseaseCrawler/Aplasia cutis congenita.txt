This absence of skin most commonly affects the scalp, but any location of the body surface can be affected, including the truck, arms, and legs. Most patients with aplasia cutis congenita have no other abnormalities, although the condition may be associated with congenital malformations involving the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and central nervous systems. The cause of this condition is unclear and appears to be multifactorial (many different factors appear to play a role); teratogens, genetic factors, trauma, and compromised skin perfusion each seem to play a role.
