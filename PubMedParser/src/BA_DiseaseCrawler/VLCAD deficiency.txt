{'terms': '', 'desc': '\nVLCAD deficiency is a condition that prevents the body from converting certain fats to energy, particularly during periods without food (fasting). People with this condition have inadequate levels of an enzyme that metabolizes a group of fats called very long-chain fatty acids. Signs and symptoms of this disorder typically occur during infancy or childhood and include low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), lack of energy, and muscle weakness. These children are also at risk of serious complications such as liver abnormalities and life-threatening heart problems. Symptoms that begin in adolescence or adulthood tend to be milder and usually do not involve heart problems. Mutations in the ACADVL gene cause VLCAD deficiency, and this disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency', u'VLCADD'], 'uid': u'201475'}
