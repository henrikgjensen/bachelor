{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Glycine encephalopathy is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormally high levels of a molecule called glycine. This molecule is a building block of proteins and also acts as a chemical messenger that transmits signals in the brain. Glycine encephalopathy is caused by the shortage of an enzyme that normally breaks down glycine in the body. A lack of this enzyme allows excess glycine to build up in tissues and organs, particularly the brain, leading to serious medical problems. Symptoms typically appear during infancy or early childhood and include a lack of energy (lethargy), feeding difficulties, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), abnormal jerking movements, breathing problems, seizures, and mental retardation.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'GCE', u'NKH', u'Nonketotic hyperglycinemia', u'Hyperglycinemia', u' nonketotic'], 'uid': u'605899'}
