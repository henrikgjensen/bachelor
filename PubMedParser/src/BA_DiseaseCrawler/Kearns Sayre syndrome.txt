In addition, affected individuals have at least one of the following: cardiac conduction block, cerebrospinal fluid protein concentration greater than  mg/dL, or cerebellar ataxia. Kearns-Sayre syndrome is a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion syndrome. It results from abnormalities in the DNA of mitochondria - small rod-like structures found in every cell of the body that produce the energy that drives cellular functions. This and other mitochondrial diseases correlate with specific DNA mutations that cause problems with many of the organs and tissues in the body, resulting in multisystem effects. Treatment for this slowly progressive disorder is generally symptomatic and supportive.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'KSS', u'Ophthalmoplegia', u' pigmentary degeneration of retina', u' and cardiomyopathy', u'Oculocraniosomatic syndrome', u'Ophthalmoplegia plus syndrome', u'Mitochondrial cytopathy', u'Ophthalmoplegia', u' progressive external', u' with ragged red fibers', u'Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia with myopathy', u'CPEO with myopathy', u'CPEO with ragged red fibers'], 'uid': ''}
