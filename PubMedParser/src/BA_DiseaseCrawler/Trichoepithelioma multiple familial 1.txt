{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Multiple familial trichoepithelioma is a rare condition characterized by multiple smooth, round, firm, skin-colored papules that usually occur on the face, but may also occur on the scalp, neck, and trunk. The lesions are derived from immature hair follicles. They may get bigger over time, but they usually do not ulcerate. Treatment often involves surgery to remove a single lesion and cryosurgery or laser surgery for multiple ones. It is caused by a mutation in the CYLD gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'MFT1', u'Epithelioma adenoides cysticum of Brooke', u'EAC', u'Epithelioma hereditary multiple benign cystic', u'Brooke-Fordyce trichoepitheliomas'], 'uid': u'601606'}
