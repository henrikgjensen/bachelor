Because carcinoid tumors grow slowly and don't produce symptoms in the early stages, the average age of people diagnosed with digestive or lung carcinoid is about . In later stages the tumors sometimes produce hormones that can cause carcinoid syndrome. The syndrome causes flushing of the face and upper chest, diarrhea, and trouble breathing.
