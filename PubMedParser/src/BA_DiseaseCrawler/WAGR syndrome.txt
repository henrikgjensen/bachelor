WAGR is an acronym for Wilms tumor, Aniridia, Genitourinary anomalies (such as undescended testicles or hypospadias in males, or internal genital or urinary anomalies in females), mental Retardation syndrome. A combination of two or more of these conditions is usually present in most individuals with WAGR syndrome. The syndrome is due to a microdeletion in the p region of chromosome . In most cases, this genetic change occurs spontaneously during early embryonic development (de novo) for unknown reasons (sporadic). Only rarely is the mutation inherited.
