It is an autosomal recessive condition caused by a defect in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) gene. The defect makes the body unable to create lipoproteins (molecules of fat combined with protein). Persons with this condition are unable to properly digest fat and essential vitamins, compromising normal growth, development, and maintenance of the body's cells and tissues, particularly nerve cells and tissues in the eye. Dietary modification along with fat-soluble vitamin (vitamins A, D, E and K) and medium chain triglyceride supplements are often recommended for treatment of this conditon.", 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Bassen Kornzweig syndrome', u'Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein deficiency disease', u'Microsomal-triglyceride transfer protein deficiency', u'ABL', u'Low-density beta lipoprotein deficiency', u'Abetalipoproteinemia neuropathy', u'Apolipoprotein B deficiency', u'Betalipoprotein deficiency disease', u'Congenital betalipoprotein deficiency syndrome'], 'uid': ''}
