{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Fabry disease is an inherited disorder that is caused by the buildup of a specific type of fat called globotriasylceramide.  The buildup occurs because individuals with Fabry disease have a mutation in the GLA gene.  The GLA gene provides instructions for the making of an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A.  The mutation in the GLA gene changes the structure and function of alpha-galactosidase A, preventing the breakdown of globotriasylceramide.  The buildup leads to the damage of the cells lining blood vessels and cells in the kidneys, heart, and nervous system.  The damage caused by the buildup leads to the various symptoms of Fabry disease.
