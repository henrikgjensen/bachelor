{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Hereditary coproporphyria is an autosomal dominant form of liver (hepatic) porphyria that is very similar to acute intermittent porphyria, although it is usually a less severe disease. It results from low levels of the enzyme responsible for the sixth step in heme production - coproporphyrinogen oxidase. This enzyme speeds the conversion of coproporphyrinogen to protoporphyrinogen. In coproporphyria, the porphyrin precursors porphobilinogen and amino-levulinic acid (ALA) accumulate, as well as the formed porphyrin coproporphyrin. This leads to abdominal pain, neuropathies, constipation, and skin changes. Treatment is dependent on the symptoms.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Hereditary coproporphyria', u'Coproporphyria hereditary', u'Hereditary coproporphyria porphyria', u'Porphyria hepatica coproporphyria', u'Porphyria hepatica II', u'HCP', u'Coproporphyrinogen oxidase deficiency', u'CPO deficiency', u'CPRO deficiency', u'CPX deficiency'], 'uid': u'121300'}
