Adenoid cystic carcinoma is found mainly in the head and neck, but can occasionally occur in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s uterus or other sites in the body. It most commonly occurs in the salivary glands, in locations such as the palate (the roof of the mouth), nasopharynx (air passageway at the upper part of the throat and behind the nose), inner lining of the mouth, larynx, or trachea. Symptoms may include difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, dull pain, numbness or palpable lumps. Regardless of its location, adenoid cystic carcinoma tends to spread along nerves or through the bloodstream. A small percentage of cases spread to the lymph nodes. The most common location for metatasis is the lung. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is often unpredictable, with long periods of no activity followed by rapid growth. The cause of adenoid cystic carcinoma is not known and no specific risk factors have been identified. Treatment depends on the size and location of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread, and the patient's overall health, but may include surgery, radiation or chemotherapy.", 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Adenocystic carcinoma', u'Cribriform carcinoma', u'Cylindroma'], 'uid': ''}
