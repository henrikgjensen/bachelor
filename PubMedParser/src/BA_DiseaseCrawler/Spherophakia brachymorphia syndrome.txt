Skeletal manifestations include short stature; brachdactyly; and limited joint mobility, especially of the hands.  The primary ocular manifestation is microspherophakia (small and relatively spherical crystalline lens with increased antero-posterior thickness), with occasional ectopia of the lenses, severe myopia, and glaucoma. Some patients also have cardiac involvement. Autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant forms of Weill-Marchesani syndrome have been identified. These forms cannot be distinguished by clinical findings alone.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Weill-Marchesani syndrome', u'WMS&#9;', u'WM syndrome', u'Mesodermal dysmorphodystrophy', u' congenital'], 'uid': ''}
