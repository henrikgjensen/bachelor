Patients with this condition are likely to have systemic involvement, including angioedema, arthralgias, pulmonary disease, abdominal or chest pain, fever, renal disease, and episcleritis. Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis is thought be an autoimmune response involving a specific region of complement  (C). It can present as or precede a syndrome that includes obstructive pulmonary disease , uveitis, systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), Sj\xc3\xb6gren's syndrome, or cryoglobulinemia (which is closely linked with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection). Some cases of hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis respond to therapies commonly used for the treatment of SLE, including low-dose prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, or other immunomodulatory agents.
