{'terms': '', 'desc': 'SCOT deficiency is a metabolic disease that is caused by reduced or missing levels of -ketoacid CoA transferase. This enzyme is necessary for the body to use ketones. Keytones are substances produced when fat cells break down and are an important source of energy, especially when there is a shortage of glucose. SCOT deficiency is characterized by intermittent ketoacidosis, with the first episode often occurring in newborns or infants ( to  months). In ketoacidosis keytones build-up in the body. Symptoms of ketoacidosis may vary but can include trouble breathing, poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, unconsciousness, and coma. Crises need to be addressed immediately. Fortunately these crises tend to respond well to IV fluids including glucose and sodium bicarbonate. Patients with SCOT defiency are symptom free between episodes. This deficiency can be caused by mutations in the OXCT gene.
