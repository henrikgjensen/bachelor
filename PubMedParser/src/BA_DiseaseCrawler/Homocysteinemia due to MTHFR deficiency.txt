Some MTHFR mutations are rare, others are common. These mutations may cause a mild to severe loss of activity of the MTHFR enzyme and result in elevated levels of homocysteine in the blood (homocysteinemia) or urine (homocysteinuria). The most common MTHFR gene mutation is the CT mutation. Symptoms of MTHFR deficiency vary from no symptoms to severe neurologic and blood vessel disease. Health problems tend not to be related to whether someone has a MTHFR gene mutation or even a MTHFR enzyme deficiency, but whether the deficiency is leading to elevated levels of homocysteine in the blood (homocysteinemia) or urine.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Homocysteinemia due to methylenetetrahydro-folate reductase deficiency', u'MTHFR deficiency', u'Methylenetetrahydro-folate reductase deficiency', u'Homocysteinuria due to MTHFR deficiency', u'Homocysteinuria due to methylenetetrahydro-folate reductase deficiency', u'5', u'10-alpha-methylenetetrahydro-folate reductase deficiency', u'5', u'10 alpha methylenetetrahydro-folate reductase deficiency'], 'uid': ''}
