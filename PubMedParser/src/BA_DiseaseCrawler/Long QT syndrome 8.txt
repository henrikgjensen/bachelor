Other symptoms of Timothy syndrome include fusion of the skin between fingers or toes and distinctive facial features. In addition, many children with this syndrome have developmental delay and characteristic features of autism. Mental retardation and seizures can also occur in children with Timothy syndrome.There are two forms of Timothy syndrome. Type  includes all of the characteristic features described. Type  causes a more severe form of long QT syndrome and does not appear to cause fusion of skin between fingers or toes. All cases of Timothy syndrome appear to be due to changes in the CACNAC gene. This syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. However, most cases are not inherited from an affected parent, but occur for the first time in a family due to a spontaneous or random change in the CACNAC gene.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'LQT8', u'Long QT syndrome with syndactyly', u'Timothy syndrome'], 'uid': ''}
