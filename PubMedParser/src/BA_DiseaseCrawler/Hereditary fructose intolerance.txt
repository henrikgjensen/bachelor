{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is a metabolic disease caused by the absence of an enzyme called aldolase B. In people with HFI, ingestion of fructose (fruit sugar) and sucrose (cane or beet sugar, table sugar) causes severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and progressive liver damage. In addition, blocked processing of fructose will cause a build-up of substances that damage the liver. HFI may be relatively mild or a very severe disease, and treatment involves eliminating fructose and sucrose from the diet. In the severe form, eliminating these sugars from the diet may not prevent progressive liver disease.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Fructose-1-phosphate aldolase deficiency', u'ALDOB deficiency', u'Aldolase B deficiency', u'Fructose-1', u'6-bisphosphate aldolase B deficiency', u'Fructose intolerance', u' hereditary'], 'uid': u'229600'}
