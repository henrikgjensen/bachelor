{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is a genetic condition that is characterized by the growth of cysts in the kidneys and liver and problems in other organs, such as the blood vessels in the brain and heart. The cysts in the kidney decrease kidney function and lead to kidney failure.  The severity of the disease varies from person to person.  Although a cure has not been found for the disease, some symptoms of the condition may be controlled by medicines, antibiotics, healthy diet, and growth hormones.  The condition is caused by a mutation in the PKHD gene.  Other genes for the disease might exist but have not been identified.
