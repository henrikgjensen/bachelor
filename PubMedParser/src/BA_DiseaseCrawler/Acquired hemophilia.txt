The most common coagulation factor attacked is coagulation factor VIII, though other coagulation factors, including factor V and factor IX have been associated with the condition. The production of autoantibodies is sometimes associated with pregnancy, immune system disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren syndrome), viral infections cancer, or allergic reactions to certain drugs. In about half of cases, the cause of acquired hemophilia is unknown. Treatment may vary from person to person.
