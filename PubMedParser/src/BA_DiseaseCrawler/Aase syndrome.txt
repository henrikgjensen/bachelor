In some instances, additional abnormalities may be present. Most cases of Aase syndrome occur without a known reason and are not passed down through families (inherited). However, some cases have been shown to be inherited as an autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive trait. Aase syndrome is sometimes classified as a type of Diamond-Blackfan anemia.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Aase Smith syndrome 2', u'Anemia and triphalangeal thumbs', u'Congenital anemia and triphalangeal thumbs', u'Hypoplastic anemia triphalangeal thumbs Aase-Smith type'], 'uid': ''}
