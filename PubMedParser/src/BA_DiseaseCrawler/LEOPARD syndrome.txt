LEOPARD is an acronym for the features of this condition: (L)entigines (multiple dark spots on the skin); (E)lectrocardiographic conduction defects (abnormalities of the electrical activity of the heart); ()cular hypertelorism (widely spaced eyes); (P)ulmonary stenosis (obstruction of the normal outflow of blood from the right ventricle of the heart); (A)bnormalities of the genitalia; (R)etarded growth resulting in short stature; and (D)eafness or hearing loss.The signs and symptoms of LEOPARD syndrome vary among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. This condition is called LEOPARD syndrome  when it is caused by mutations in the PTPN gene and LEOPARD syndrome  when it is caused by mutations in the RAF gene. Most cases are inherited from a parent in an autosomal dominant pattern. Less often, LEOPARD syndrome occurs in people without a family history of the condition due to a new gene mutation.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Lentigines', u' Electrocardiographic conduction abnormalities', u' Ocular hypertelorism', u' Pulmonic stenosis', u' Abnormal genitalia', u' Retardation of growth', u' Deafness', u'Multiple lentigines syndrome', u'Cardiomyopathic lentiginosis', u'LEOPARD syndrome 1 &#40;subtype&#41;', u'LEOPARD syndrome 2 &#40;subtype&#41;'], 'uid': ''}
