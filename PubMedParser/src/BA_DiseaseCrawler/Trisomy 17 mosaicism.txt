Trisomy  mosaicism is one of the rarest trisomies in humans. It is often incorrectly called trisomy  (also referred to as full trisomy ), a chromosomal abnormality in which an individual has three copies of chromosome  in all of cells of the body. Trisomy  has never been reported in any living individuals in the medical literature. Only  cases of trisomy  mosaicism have been described, most of them have been detected during pregnancy (prenatally) through a test called amniocentesis. In most of these cases, the diagnosis of trisomy  mosaicism could not be confirmed in the baby after birth, leading some to propose that the abnormal cells detected in the prenatal test results may have come from tissues that are not part of the fetus in most cases. There have only been a handful of people in whom the diagnosis of trisomy  mosacism was confirmed after birth. Because the number of cells with trisomy  and the location of the tissues affected differ from case to case, the clinical signs and symptoms (if there are any) vary significantly from person to person. Symptom management is based on the person\xe2\x80\x99s clinical signs and medical needs.
