The condition manifests as acute or subacute attacks of visual loss or blindness, motor weakness, sensory impairment, and bladder and bowel dysfunction. There is no proven effective treatment, but patients are usually given anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive medications. The prognosis is generally poor; most patients sustain disabling visual loss and weakness.  This condition is likely an autoimmune disease. In its early stages, Devic disease may be confused with multiple sclerosis.
