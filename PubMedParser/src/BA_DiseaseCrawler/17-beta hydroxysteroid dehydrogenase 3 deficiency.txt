{'terms': '', 'desc': '-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  deficiency is a genetic condition that affects male sexual development. People with this deficiency are genetically male, with one X and one Y chromosome in each cell, and they have testes. Their bodies, however, do not produce enough of the male sex hormone testosterone. Without the adequate amount of testosterone, external sex organs development is disrupted. Therefore, most people with -beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  deficiency are born with external genitalia that appear female. In some cases, the external genitalia do not look clearly male or female (sometimes called ambiguous genitalia). During puberty, people with this condition typically go on to develop male secondary sex characteristis, such as increased muscle mass, deepening of the voice, and development of male pattern body hair. Mutations (changes) in the gene called HSDB cause -beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  deficiency. The HSDB gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is active in the testes, where it helps to produce testosterone. A shortage of testosterone affects the development of the reproductive tract in the male fetus, resulting in the abnormalities in the external sex organs that occur in the condition. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, which means that a person needs to inherit two mutated copies of the HSDB gene-one from each parent-in order to development signs and symptoms of -beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  deficiency.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'17 alpha ketosteroid reductase deficiency of testis', u'17 alpha KSR deficiency', u'Neutral 17 beta hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase deficiency', u'Male pseudoherma-phroditism with gynecomastia', u'17 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase III deficiency'], 'uid': u'264300'}
