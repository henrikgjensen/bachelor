Patients are diagnosed with thrombocytopenia (a blood disorder characterized by too few platelets (which help blood clot) in the blood) and Coombs' positive hemolytic anemia (an abnormality of the immune system that causes red blood cells to be destroyed prematurely) and have no other known underlying etiology. The patients may be affected by low levels of all three types of blood cells at one time, or may only have problems with one or two of them.", 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Autoimmune hemolytic anemia and autoimmune thrombocytopenia', u'Evan syndrome'], 'uid': ''}
