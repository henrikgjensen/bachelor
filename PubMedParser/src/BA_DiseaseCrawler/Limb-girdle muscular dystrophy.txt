{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy refers to more than a dozen inherited conditions marked by progressive loss of muscle bulk and symmetrical weakening of voluntary muscles, primarily those in the shoulders and around the hips. Some forms of the disease progress rapidly while others advance very slowly over many years. In most cases, both parents must pass on the altered gene for a child to have the disease (autosomal recessive disorder). However, in some rare types only one parent needs to pass on the altered gene to affect the child (autosomal dominant disorder). For some of these conditions, the defective gene has been discovered. For others, the gene is not yet known. Most persons with limb-girdle MD become severely disabled within  years of disease onset.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy autosomal recessive', u'LGMD- autosomal recessive', u'Limb girdle muscular dystrophy'], 'uid': u'253600'}
