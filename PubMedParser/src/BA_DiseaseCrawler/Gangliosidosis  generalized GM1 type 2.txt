{'terms': '', 'desc': 'GM gangliosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the generalized accumulation of GM ganglioside, oligosaccharides, and the mucopolysaccharide keratan sulfate (and their derivatives). GM gangliosidosisis is caused by a deficiency of beta-galactosidase, which leads to the above-mentioned accumulation of gangliosides within specific tissues of the body. This disorder causes progressive neurological damage and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. There are three types of GM gangliosidosis: classic infantile (type ), juvenile (type ), and late (adult) onset or chronic (type ).
