{'terms': '', 'desc': "Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of genetic disorders that mainly affect the bones. People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from mild trauma or with no apparent cause. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can occur even before birth. Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime. There are at least eight recognized forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, designated type I through type VIII. The types can be distinguished by their signs and symptoms, as well as by genetic factors. ", 'db': 'pubmed', 'syn': [u'OI', u'Brittle bone disease'], 'uid': u'tinyurl.com/6qg3cv'}
