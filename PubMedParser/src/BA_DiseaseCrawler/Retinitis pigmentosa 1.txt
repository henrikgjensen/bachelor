{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the name given to a group of inherited eye diseases that affect the light-sensitive part of the eye (retina). RP causes the breakdown cells in the retina that detect light and help us see. As these cells breakdown and die, people with RP lose their vision. The first sign of RP is typically night blindness. As the condition progresses, affected individuals usually lose their peripheral vision, which is called tunnel vision. There are many different genetic causes of RP. Sometimes RP occurs by itself (isolated RP), and other times it occurs with additional signs and symptoms (syndromic RP). There is no cure for RP, however, there are a few treatment options to slow down the progression of the disease. These options include light avoidance, use of low-vision aids, and vitamin A supplementation.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'RP1'], 'uid': u'180100'}
