Symptoms may include a yellowish color to the skin (jaundice), and a liver that is sometimes enlarged and tender.  The symptoms often do not present until puberty or adulthood. The syndrome interferes with the body's ability to move bilirubin from the liver. In most cases, treatment is not required.
