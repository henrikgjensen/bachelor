It can also be more broadly classified as an inborn error of metabolism, because it is caused by an error in the pterin metabolism. Pterin metabolism plays an important role in making neurotransmitters in the brain, specifically dopamine, serotonin, biopterin, and their metabolites. This deficiency is caused by mutations in the SPR gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Common symptoms include developmental delay, learning disability, and impaired motor skills. Treatment with levodopa has shown much success causing drastic improvements in motor functioning.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [], 'uid': ''}
