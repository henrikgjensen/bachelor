This condition is very similar to hypoparathyroidism, with low calcium levels and high phosphate levels in the blood. This results in the characteristic symptoms which are generally first seen in childhood. There are two different types of pseudohypoparathyroidism, both of which are caused by abnormal genes. Type I can be further divided into two sub-types: type Ia is caused by a one-gene abnormality, inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This defect also causes short stature, round face, and short hand bones, and is also called Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy.\n", 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [], 'uid': ''}
