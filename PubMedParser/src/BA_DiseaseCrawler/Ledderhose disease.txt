While many individuals with Ledderhose disease do not experience symptoms, over time the condition may progress, causing considerable pain when walking. Repeated trauma, long-term alcohol consumption, chronic liver disease, diabetes, and epilepsy have been reported in association with the development of this condition. Heredity is also a clear factor in many patients. Often, patients with Ledderhose disease also have other fibrosing conditions such as Dupuytren contracture, knuckle pads, or Peyronie disease.", 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [], 'uid': ''}
