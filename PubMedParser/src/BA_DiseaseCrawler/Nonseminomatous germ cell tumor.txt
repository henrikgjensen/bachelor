They originate from cells that were meant to form sex cells (i.e., sperm or eggs). They are often large and have a tendency to spread more quickly than the other type of germ cell tumor (i.e., seminoma type). Possible early signs of this cancer include chest pain and breathing problems.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'NSGCT', u'Non-seminomatous germ-cell tumors'], 'uid': ''}
