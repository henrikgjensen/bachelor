This condition, which primarily affects females, occurs when neurons migrate to an area of the brain where they are not supposed to be (heterotopia), and form abnormal areas that appear as band-like clusters of white tissue underneath the gray tissue of the cerebral cortex. Since these bands are located beneath the cerebral cortex, they are said to be subcortical. Symptoms can vary from severe intellectual disability and epilepsy to normal intelligence with mild or no epilepsy. Double cortex syndrome is most often caused by mutations in the DCX gene. The condition is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. Some cases may be caused by a small deletion on chromosome  involving the LIS gene Management consists of seizure control. In about % the epilepsy is refractory to antiepileptic therapy. ', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'DC', u'Subcortical band heterotopia', u'Double cortex'], 'uid': ''}
