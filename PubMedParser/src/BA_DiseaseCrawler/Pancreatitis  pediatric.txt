Acute refers to conditions that occur suddenly and have a short course.  Symptoms of acute pediatric pancreatitis may include stomach pain, persistent vomiting, and fever. Common causes include blunt abdominal injury, structural defects (e.g., pancreas divisum), medications, viruses, and gallstones. Acute pediatric pancreatitis may also be associated with systemic disease (e.g., hemolytic uremic syndrome). If left untreated acute pancreatitis can progress to the chronic form which is more persistent and involves inflammation and scarring of the pancreas.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [], 'uid': ''}
