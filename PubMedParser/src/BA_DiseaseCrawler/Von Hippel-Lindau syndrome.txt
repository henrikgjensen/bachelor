{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is a genetic multi-system disorder characterized by the abnormal growth of tumors in certain parts of the body (angiomatosis). The specific tumors that are associated with VHL syndrome include hemangioblastomas (tumors comprised of a nest of blood vessels) of the brain, spinal cord, and retina; kidney cysts and clear cell kidney cell carcinoma; pheochromocytoma (a type of noncancerous tumor that affects the adrenal glands, which are the small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney); and endolymphatic sac tumors (a type of tumor of the inner ear area called the endolymphatic sac). Mutations in the VHL gene cause von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. These mutations are  inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Detecting and treating VHL early is important. Treatment usually involves surgery or sometimes radiation therapy. The goal is to treat growths while they are small and before they do permanent damage.
