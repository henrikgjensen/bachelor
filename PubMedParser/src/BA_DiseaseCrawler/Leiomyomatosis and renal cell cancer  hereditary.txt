Signs and symptoms usually begin in adulthood and include leiomyomas in the skin and, in females, the uterus (i.e., fibroids). Leiomyomas are benign (noncancerous) tumors containing smooth muscle tissue. People with this condition also have an increased risk of kidney cancer. It is caused by mutations in the FH gene. It is passed through families in an autosomal dominant fashion.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'LRCC', u'Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer', u'HLRCC'], 'uid': ''}
