PLEVA is characterized by skin lesions that ulcerate, breakdown, form open sores, then form a red-brown crust. FUMHD often begins as PLEVA, but then rapidly and suddenly progresses to large, destructive ulcers. There may be fever and extensive, painful loss of skin tissue as well as secondary infection of the ulcers. Diagnosis of FUMHD is confirmed by biopsy of skin lesions. FUMHD occurs more frequently in children, peaking at age  to . Males tend to be affected more often than females. While some cases of FUMHD have resolved without therapy others have resulted in death. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment may help to reduce morbidity and death.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'FUMHD', u'A severe variant of pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta &#40;PLEVA&#41;', u'Ulceronecrotic Mucha-Habermann disease', u'Variant of Mucha-Habermann disease'], 'uid': ''}
