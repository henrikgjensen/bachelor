{'terms': '', 'desc': 'Neurofibromatosis type  is a disorder characterized by the growth of noncancerous tumors in the nervous system. The most common tumors associated with neurofibromatosis type  are called vestibular schwannomas or acoustic neuromas. These growths develop along the nerve that carries information from the inner ear to the brain (the auditory nerve). Tumors that occur on nerves in other areas of the brain or spinal cord are also commonly seen with this condition. Mutations in the NF gene cause neurofibromatosis type . Neurofibromatosis type  is considered to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.', 'db': u'omim', 'syn': [u'NF 2', u'Neurofibromatosis central type', u'Acoustic schwannomas bilateral', u'Bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis', u'Acoustic neurinoma bilateral', u'Neurofibromatosis type II'], 'uid': u'101000'}
