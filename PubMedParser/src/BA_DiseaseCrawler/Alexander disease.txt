It is characterized by the destruction of white matter in the brain and abnormal protein deposits known as Rosenthal fibers. Most cases of Alexander disease begin before age  years (the infantile form). Symptoms of the infantile form include an enlarged brain and head, seizures, stiffness in the arms and/or legs, mental retardation, and delayed physical development. Less frequently, onset occurs later in childhood (the juvenile form) or adulthood. Common problems in juvenile and adult forms of Alexander disease include speech abnormalities, swallowing difficulties, and poor coordination.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Alexanders leukodystrophy', u'Megalencephaly in infancy accompanied by progressive spasticity and dementia'], 'uid': ''}
