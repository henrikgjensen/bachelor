EGIDs can affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract, singly or in combination, and are named accordingly: eosinophilic esophagitis, gastritis, gastroenteritis, enteritis, and colitis.  The diagnosis of EGID is primarily dependent on the clinical history and the pathology results of multiple biopsy specimens after ruling out other causes of intestinal eosinophilia.  Approximately % of individuals with EGID have demonstrated allergies, and % have a familial form.  Treatment involves evaluation for food sensitivity, elimination diets, and the use of antiallergy and anti-inflammatory medications with varying degrees of success.  Little is known about the natural history of EGIDs.  Routine endoscopic and cardiopulmonary evaluations are recommended.', 'db': u'pubmed', 'syn': [u'Eosinophilic gastroenteritis', u'Eosinophilic gastritis', u'Eosinophilic enteritis', u'Eosinophilic gastroenteropathy', u'Eosinophilic esophagitis'], 'uid': ''}
