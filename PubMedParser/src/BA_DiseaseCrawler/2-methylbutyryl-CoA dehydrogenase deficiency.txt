{'terms': '', 'desc': '-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is a metabolic disorder in which individuals lack adequate levels of an enzyme called -methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase. This enzyme assists in the processing of a particular amino acid called isoleucine. The inability to process isoleucine correctly leads to the buildup of the amino acid in the body.  The buildup can cause a variety of health problems, which vary widely from severe and life-threatening to mild or absent.  Signs and symptoms of the disorder can begin a few days after birth or later in childhood.  The initial symptoms often include poor feeding, lack of energy, vomiting, and irritability.
