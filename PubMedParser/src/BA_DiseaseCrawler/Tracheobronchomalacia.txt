Tracheomalacia (TM) refers to a condition in which the trachea is weak and has collapsed usually due to deficiency of cartilage in a certain area or throughout the trachea.  If the mainstem bronchi are involved as well, the term tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is used.  It should be noted that, historically, many authors have used TM and TBM interchangeably, especially in studies found in the pediatric literature.
