In general, syndactyly is classified as complete (fingers that are joined all the way to the finger tips) or incomplete (fingers that are joined only part way up the fingers). Additionally, syndactyly is classified as simple (fingers that are joined by skin and soft tissue only) or complex (fingers in which underlying bones are also joined together).
