It can be time consuming for a physician to diagnose a disease and
even more so if the disease is rare. Many rare disease have a high
fatality rate so a quick diagnosis is vital to the health of the
patient. We therefore propose a prototype support decision system for
diagnosing rare diseases with a specialized database. For this we will
be using a vector space model to look for similarity between input
symptoms and gathered information. Given a list of symptoms, the
system will calculate a similarity score between the search query and
the documents in the matrix. \\

The system was tested using 13 test cases from
BMJ \cite{HangwiTang11102006}, 30 test cases from Orpha.net and X \fxnote{X}
blind tests provided by chief physician Henrik J\o rgensen and Lennart Y. \fxnote{Lennart?}
In a top 20 the system succesfully returned 8 out of 13, 20 out of 30 
and ``blindtest'' correct diseases.

, which is very exciting and proves the
possibilities of the system. Although more control over the initial
information that the system gathers is needed. And there needs to be a
threshold of the minimum number of Medline records per disease.\\
