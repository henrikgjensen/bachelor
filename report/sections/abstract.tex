It can be time consuming for a physician to diagnose a disease and
even more so if it is a rare disease. Many rare disease have a high
fatality rate so a quick diagnosis is vital to the health of the
patient. We therefore propose a prototype support decision system for
diagnosing rare diseases with a specialized database. For this we will
be using a vector space model to look for similarity between input
symptoms and gathered information. Given a list of symptoms, the
system will calculate a similarity score between the search query and
the documents in the matrix. The system was tested using 13 test cases
from BMJ \cite{HangwiTang11102006}, 29 test cases from Orpha.net and 5
blind tests cases provided by chief physician Henrik J\o rgensen and
Lennart Friis-Hansen. In a top 20 the system returned the correct
results for 8 out of 13 for BMJ, 20 out of 29 for Orpha.net and 3 out
of 5 during the blind test. The system places $61.5\%$ of the BMJ
cases, $68\%$ of Orpha.net and $60\%$ of the blind test cases in top
20. This proves the potential of the system, and suggests that further
work within this area of research should be performed.
