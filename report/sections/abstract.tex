It can be time consuming for a physician to diagnose a disease and
even more so if the disease is rare. Many rare disease have a high
fatality rate so a quick diagnosis is vital to the health of the
patient. We therefore propose a prototype support decision system for
diagnosing rare diseases with a specialized database. For this we will
be using a vector space model to look for similarity between input
symptoms and gathered information. Given a list of symptoms, the
system will calculate a similarity score between the search query and
the documents in the matrix. The system was tested using 13 test cases
from BMJ \cite{HangwiTang11102006}, 30 test cases from Orpha.net and 5
blind tests cases provided by chief physician Henrik J\o rgensen and
Lennart Friis-Hansen. In a top 20 the system successfully returned 8
out of 13 for BMJ, 20 out of 30 for Orpha.net and 3 out of 5 during
the blind test. The  $61.5%$

, which is very exciting and proves the
possibilities of the system. Although more control over the initial
information that the system gathers is needed. And there needs to be a
threshold of the minimum number of MedLine records per disease.\\
