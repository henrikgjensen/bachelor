It can be time consuming for a physician to diagnose a disease and
even more so if the disease is rare. Many rare disease a high fatality
rate so a quick diagnosis is vital to health of the patient. We
therefore propose a prototype support decision system for diagnosing
rare diseases with a specialized database. For this we will be using a
vector space model to look for similarity between input symptoms and
gathered information. Given a list of symptoms, the system will
calculate a similarity score between the search query and the
documents in the matrix. \\


The system was tested using 13 test cases from
BMJ \cite{HangwiTang11102006} and 30 test cases from Orpha.net. In
addition to this, we performed a blind test of the system, where we
recieved a symptom list from a chief phycisian. Many diseases from the
test cases were ranked amongst top 20.

, which is very exciting and proves the
possibilities of the system. Although more control over the initial
information that the system gathers is needed. And there needs to be a
threshold of the minimum number of Medline records per disease.\\
