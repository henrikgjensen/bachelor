\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
We would like to thank our supervisor for letting us take on this
project, even though the project was not clearly defined from the
beginning. His ideas and thoughts helped us a lot when we ran into
corners.

We would like to thanks Henrik L. J\o rgensen for supplying blind test
cases on which to perform tests. And for his input to the project in
general.

We would like to thank Lennart Friis-Hansen for coming up with the
original idea for the project, and hope that others --- in the future
--- will continue our project, or others similar to it.

We would also like to thank the IT-department at the Institute of
Computer Science at Copenhagen University for allowing us to use one
of their machine for our data/text processing, without it this project
would never have been possible.

We would also like to thank the Institute of Computer Science for
allowing 24/7 access and the cantina, for coffee and facilities for
making edible meals.

And last but not least we would like to thank our friends and loved
ones for support during, especially the last three weeks of the
project.
