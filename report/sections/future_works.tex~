What could be awesome for future versions of the system?\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item Statistical model
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Prior probabilities about diseases, race, age, gender and location dependent. Building a statistical model, if enough information about the diseases can be located.
    \item Improve the classification of diseases.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Construct other term document matrices
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Base a term document matrix keywords extracted at Medline record level, see how it performs.
    \item Base a term document matrix on sub term document
  \end{itemize}
  \item Improvements involving queries / searches
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The possibility of comparing queries.
    \item Possibility of querying sub a clusters of returned diseases
    \item Apply additional query options like Authors, year, journal etc.
    \item Improve the recall in the system by performing term mapping. Meaning a search term will be mapped to all its synonyms thereby hopefully improving the recall of information.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Visualization / GUI
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Visual representation of disease cluster, including keywords around a search query.
    \item A visual representation of the results something like:
    \item \begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|r|}

\hline

Disease name & Keywords & Score & PMIDs --> (Expandable to abstracts/keywords for each) Abstracts \\

\hline

Disease$_1$ & "Cancer, lever, blood, aortic ..." & 0.8242 & $18134923$, \dots, $3289472$ \\

\hline

{} & {} & {} & {} \\

\hline

Disease$_20$ & "Cancer, lever, blood, aortic ..." & 0.2412 & $17584932$, \dots, $16191394$ \\

\end{tabular}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Improvement regarding the text mining / data retrieval for the system
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Incorporate multi disease database, e.g. mining from Orpha.net, and other sites like it. (Ask permission first)
    \item Implement a threshold for the minimum amount of information a disease should include to be part of the special gang.
    \item A golden standard for each disease, thereby applying \fxnote{REF Poultry} classification algorithm to PubMed for each disease and thereby getting the most relevant Medline records for each disease. This could hopefully improve results greatly. Though acquiring a golden standard is resource intensive task, so this is probably not very likely to happen any day soon.
    \item Implementin outlier detection: Examining how outlier removal affect the search result could be valuable. This process might concentrate the remaining information, thereby making it more likely to get the right information back. Therefore, it might be advantageous to perform a clustering on the abstracts and select some criteria on which to remove outlying abstracts. The criteria could be either removal based on some distance (threshold) to the cluster average or to remove some percentage of those abstract that lies farthest away from the cluster center. The latter of these seems to be the most fair one - mainly because it removes abstracts in proportion to the size of the cluster. One fact remains when it comes to outlier detection; care needs to be taken when removing outliers since one might just remove that single piece of correct information needed to identify the right disease.
  \end{itemize}
   \item Redesign of the system, start using a database for storing and retrieving information, optimizing by rewriting ineffective code to C code. 
  
\end{itemize}
